  - identify these concepts within code snippets

- Blocks
  - Closures, binding and scope
  - How blocks work and when we want to use them
  - Blocks and variable scope
  - Create custom methods methods that use blocks and procs
  - Understand that methods and blocks can return chunks of code(closures)
  - Methods with an explicit block parameter
  - Arguments and return values with blocks
  - When you can pass a block to a method
  - `&:symbol`
  - Arity of blocks and methods

- Testing
  - Testing Terminology
  - Minitest vs. Rspec
  - SEAT Approach
  - Testing equality
  - Assertions

- Packaging code into a Project
  - Purpose of core tools
  - Gemfile

## Additional Requirements

### Ruby Version
 
Use Ruby 3.2.x

### Rubocop

- Solution for the coding challenge will be tested using Rubocop.
- Rubocop configuration used will be the one in the .rubocop.yml file in this assignment
  - [Rubocop Config File](https://launchschool.com/lessons/dfff5f6b/assignments/a464ac3e)
- recommended version of Rubocop to 1.51.0 in June 2023
- check version https://launchschool.com/lessons/a0f3cd44/assignments/8e770c8a
- properly configured to use Rubocop 1.51.0

### Minitest

- The coding challenge relies on Minitest to describe the expected behavior of your code. 
- you will have to read the tests to get a complete understanding of what is expected.
- The exact version of Minitest doesn't matter.

### Regex

- Regular expressions aren't officially a part of this assessment

### The Coding Challenge

- The final question of the assessment asks you to write a program that solves a coding challenge
- Be sure to study the test cases to find the implicit requirements.
- You should be prepared to spend up to an hour on the challenge
- To practice for the code challenge, you should do at least ten different problems from the Exercise Challenges
- at least three from the Medium section
