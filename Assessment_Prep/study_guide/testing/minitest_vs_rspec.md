# Minitest vs. Rspec

RSpec and Minitest are both used for writing tests for Ruby Programs but Minitest is the default testing library for Ruby. Minitest is a bundled gem that comes installed with Ruby while RSpec does not.

RSpec is a Domain Specific Language for writing tests that reads like natural english. Minitest can be used both using a Domain Specific Language and simple Ruby Syntax. However, RSpec can only be used via its DSL. Minitest is much simpler to get started with as it allows simple Ruby syntax.
